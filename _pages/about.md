Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

My name is Daniel Posmik and I am an aspiring Biostatistician. I am interested in robust causal inference, network data, and high-dimensional statistics. My research vision is to develop statistical tools for policymakers seeking to understand how environmental factors affect public health. 

I am currently a non-degree seeking graduate student at the University of Chicago. Starting January 2024, I am fortunate to contribute to [Professor Guanglei Hong](https://voices.uchicago.edu/ghong/)'s research in various methodological topics in causal inference, i.e. causal mediation analysis. I previously worked at the [University of Chicago's Energy and Environment Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment). 

In my free-time, I am an avid climber, mountaineer, and lover of dogs. If you are interested in having a chat on any of the above, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
