My name is Daniel Posmik [(He/Him/His)](https://pronouns.org/what-and-why) and I am a doctoral student in the Biostatistics Department at Brown University. 

My interest lies at the intersection of causal inference, statistical network analysis, and machine learning. My goal is to develop assumption-lean inference methods for high-dimensional and dependent data. I am motivated by applying my work to problems in public health and medicine.   

I was previously at the University of Chicago where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Guanglei Hong](https://voices.uchicago.edu/ghong/). Before that, I worked on causal inference and machine learning at the [UChicago Energy and Environment Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment). 

In my free-time, I am an avid outdoorsman, cyclist, and lover of dogs. If you are interested in having a chat on any of the above, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at daniel_posmik[at]brown[dot]edu.
