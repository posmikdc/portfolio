My name is Daniel Posmik [(He/Him/His)](https://inclusion.uchicago.edu/lgbtq-student-life/lgbtq-resources/#collapse4) and I am an aspiring Biostatistician. I am interested in assumption-lean causal inference under complex interference patterns. In particular, I am excited to study network confounding, graphical models, and dynamic treatment regimes. My research vision is to develop statistical tools for policymakers seeking to understand how environmental factors affect public health. 

I am currently a graduate student at the University of Chicago and a graduate research assistant for [Prof. Guanglei Hong](https://voices.uchicago.edu/ghong/). Our work has focused on the validity of instrumental variables in sequential and multi-site treatment settings. Previously, I worked at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning at the [UChicago Energy and Environment Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment). 

In my free-time, I am an avid climber, mountaineer, and lover of dogs. If you are interested in having a chat on any of the above, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
