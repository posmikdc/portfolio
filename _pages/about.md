My name is Daniel Posmik [(He/Him/His)](https://inclusion.uchicago.edu/lgbtq-student-life/lgbtq-resources/#collapse4) and I am an aspiring Biostatistician. I am interested in robust causal inference, network data, and high-dimensional statistics. My research vision is to develop statistical tools for policymakers seeking to understand how environmental factors affect public health. 

I am currently a non-degree seeking graduate student at the University of Chicago. Starting January 2024, I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Guanglei Hong](https://voices.uchicago.edu/ghong/) on various topics in causal inference methodology, i.e. causal mediation analysis. I previously worked at the [University of Chicago's Energy and Environment Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment). 

In my free-time, I am an avid climber, mountaineer, and lover of dogs. If you are interested in having a chat on any of the above, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
