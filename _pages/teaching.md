At the University of Chicago, I am a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the following course:

### Econometrics (ECON21020) (Spring Quarter, 2024) 

**Course Description:** Required of students who are majoring in economics; those students are encouraged to meet this requirement by the end of their third year. This course covers the single and multiple linear regression model, the associated distribution theory, and testing procedures; corrections for heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, and simultaneous equations; and other extensions as time permits. Students also apply the techniques to a variety of data sets using PCs.
