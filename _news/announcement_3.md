I am excited to announce that I am starting a research assistantship with Professor [Guanglei Hong](https://voices.uchicago.edu/ghong/) in January 2024. I will support Prof. Hong work on various methodological aspects in causal inference, i.e. causal mediation analysis and cumulative treatment scenarios.

>  Dr. Hong develops and applies causal inference theories and methods for evaluating educational and social policies and programs in multi-level, longitudinal settings. Her work is currently focused on developing concepts and methods for analyzing causal mediation mechanisms, for revealing spillover effects, and for conducting sensitivity analysis. She has received research funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education, the William T Grant Foundation, the Spencer Foundation, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada. She leads an NSF Summer Institute in Advanced Research Methods for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education Research (SIARM for STEM) from 2020-2024.
